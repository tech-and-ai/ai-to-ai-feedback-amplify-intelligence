# AI-to-AI Feedback: Technical Design Document

**Author:** Pantaleone Ruocco (Leo)

**Version:** 1.0

## 1. System Overview

The AI-to-AI Feedback system enables smaller parameter models to consult larger frontier models when they encounter limitations, creating an intelligence amplification effect without the continuous computational cost of using frontier models for all tasks.

### 1.1 Core Concept

The system creates a structured communication channel between:
- **Primary Agent**: A smaller, cost-efficient model (e.g., Gemma 4B)
- **Consultant Agent**: A larger, more capable frontier model (e.g., Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4)

When the Primary Agent encounters a challenge beyond its capabilities, it initiates a consultation with the Consultant Agent, incorporates the feedback, and continues with its task.

## 2. Key Components

1. **Agent Manager**: Orchestrates communication between models
2. **Context Manager**: Maintains and transfers context between models
3. **Consultation Trigger**: Determines when to consult the frontier model
4. **Feedback Integrator**: Processes and incorporates feedback
5. **Session Manager**: Maintains state across multiple consultations

## 3. Data Flow

1. **Task Initiation**: User submits a task to the Primary Agent
2. **Primary Processing**: Primary Agent processes the task
3. **Consultation Triggering**: System determines if frontier model input is needed
4. **Consultation**: Context is prepared and sent to the Consultant Agent
5. **Feedback Integration**: Primary Agent incorporates the feedback
6. **Task Continuation**: Primary Agent continues with the task

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Framework (Month 1-2)
- Implement Agent Manager and Context Manager
- Basic consultation flow
- Integration with OpenRouter for model access

### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer (Month 3-4)
- Implement Consultation Trigger mechanisms
- Develop Feedback Integrator
- Add advanced context management strategies

### Phase 3: Optimization & Scaling (Month 5-6)
- Implement cost optimization strategies
- Add monitoring and analytics
- Performance tuning and scaling improvements

## 5. Conclusion

The AI-to-AI Feedback system represents a novel approach to AI deployment that balances cost efficiency with advanced capabilities. By enabling smaller models to consult frontier models only when needed, the system provides an economically viable path to deploying sophisticated AI solutions across a wide range of applications.
